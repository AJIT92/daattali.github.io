title: "How to mock a Google Form with Shiny + different ways to use persistent data with Shiny"
---

TODO write this up




NOTES
====
- draft shiny app available at http://daattali.com/shiny/google-form-mock/
- mention that sql packages don't support input sanitization and kinda weird to hack together sql statements with sprintf rather than using prepared statements  
- after publishing post: add comment on http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/share-data.html  
- show jenny the problems i'm having with googlesheets
