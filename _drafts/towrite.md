htmlwidgets learning experience:
rendervalue happens whenveer you render (so if you have a reactive value in there, it cna happen multiple times. not super clear in the docs)

i used my own datafrmetod3 in R instead of JS so that null values will get removed

add a way to get data out

add api functions

add a way to encode data into R from JS


HTMLWidgets.find

HTMLWidgets.isShiny

use opts instead of x

make api work for both %>% and shiny server
