google analytics - thank god i spent time makin gwebsite nice on mobile - 65% of traffic is from mobile. just like tagged taught me - i am not the average user, cant make assumptions based on what i think, have to test and see how people use. nice to see some of my friends i made while traveling are viewing my site (dont worry i cant see IP or pin it down to specific people). apparnetly i have 2 friends with Windows phones. Losers! I tried ensuring my hotos look good mostly on wide screen but also look ok on phones, but it looks like i should have had the priorities reversed. Glad to see IE is dead :)
