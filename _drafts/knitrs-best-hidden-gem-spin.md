# Knitr's best hidden gem: spin

## Stop knitting - start spinning

Anyone who loves the idea of dynamic report generation with R is probably a big fan of [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and its
flagship function - `knit`.  But not many people seem to know about `knit`'s awesome cousin - `spin`. Ever since my supervisor
[Jenny Bryan](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/) told me about `spin`, I've been using it extensively and it has almost completely
replaced my use of the traditional `knit`.

I was recently at an R workshop taught by [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) and chatted with some fellow R enthusiasts about knitr.  Out of the 10
useRs I asked, none of them were aware of `knitr::spin`. I also conducted a similar survey at the labs where I work, and while
evreyone I asked was an avid user of `knitr`, nobody knew about `spin` (my sample size is rather small and I haven't done any 
proper statistical significance testing, but I'd say the lack of awareness of `spin` is indeed significant).
