Combinatorial algorithms play an important enabling role in several areas of science and engineering. Many combinatorial, machine learning, and graph algorithms in particular, are characterized by irregular data-access patterns that make efficient implementation challenging on both traditional HPC and commodity platforms. Architectural features, algorithmic design and software engineering techniques, and characteristics of the input collectively determine the performance of these algorithms.

In addition, runtime support for irregular applications, programming models, the large-scale graph structure (sparse matrix) deserves attention for efficient storage, graph query and visualization for data analysis. With this workshop we aim to bring together system builders in industry and academia interested in combinatorial (graph), machine learning algorithms, data intensive applications involving them, and parallel computing.
