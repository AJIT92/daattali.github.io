	    <p>Since this site went live a few days ago, I had many people ask me how I made it.  Like a great politician, I will avoid that question almost entirely with a completely different answer: <strong>The core template that runs this website is available for anyone to use. I called it <a href="https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme">Beautiful Jekyll</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Basically, since I&#39;m kind of OCD about making everything generalised and reusable, after spending a few hours building my website
I decided to instead build a reusable template to easily make similar websites. This of course meant that I spent infinitely longer on making my site because I wanted the template to be very simple for others to understand and extend. Some would argue it was a waste of time, but it was fun :)  Since the engine behind the site is called Jekyll,
and in my completely unbiased opinion this theme is beautiful, I chose the name that I did.  </p>

<p>You can view a <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">demo of the template</a> and use it right away if you want. <strong>Please do, it&#39;ll
make me feel important :)</strong>  </p>

<p>Beautiful Jekyll is meant to be very easy and quick to use - you can make a nice simple site that supports blogging and looks great on any device (phones/laptops) within minutes. <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">Look at the demo</a> - it might just be the best link you clicked on today. Or at least in the last 20 seconds.</p>

<h2>Technical notes about this site</h2>

<p>This site is hosted by <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></strong>, which provides free hosting. It also means that the code for
the site is public and can be viewed as a git repo (<a href="https://github.com/daattali/daattali.github.io">link</a>). I&#39;ve wanted
a website for a long time but never wanted to pay ridiculous monthly hosting fees, so this was perfect for me. </p>

<p>GitHub Pages uses <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></strong>, which is a simple static-page website generator that focuses on blogging.
Being a static site generator means that the pages are built just once and just being served when their URL is hit, rather
than being dynamically created with every page load.  For my purposes this was definitely enough.</p>

<h2>Custom domain name (instead of <code>http://daattali.github.io</code>)</h2>

<p>In order to have a nice domain name, I bought a domain from <strong><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/default.aspx?dir=outbound1">Namecheap</a></strong>, mainly just because it was the cheapest legitimate domain name registrar I could find.  Buying the domain meant that I can reach my site via <code>http://deanattali.com</code> instead of  <code>http://daattali.github.io</code> (though they both work and are identical).</p>

<h3>Set up custom domain name with GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>After purchasing my domain name (deanattali.com) from Namecheap, there were a few simple settings to set to get deanattali.com to
render my GitHub page.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the git repository, I added a file named <code>CNAME</code> that contained my domain. (<a href="http://deanattali.com/CNAME">Here is my CNAME</a>)</li>
<li>I logged into Namecheap and changed the following settings under &quot;All Host Records&quot;

<ul>
<li>Set the &quot;@&quot; IP Address/URL to <code>192.30.252.153</code> and the Record Type to <code>A (Address)</code></li>
<li>Set the &quot;www&quot; IP Address/URL to <code>daattali.github.io.</code> and the Record Type to <code>CNAME (Alias)</code></li>
<li>Add a subdomain entry: <code>@</code> as the Host Name, <code>192.30.252.154</code> as the IP Address/URL, and <code>A (Address)</code> as the Record Type</li>
<li>Make sure all TTL is 1800 for all three rows</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it.  After a few minutes, <code>daattali.github.io</code> redirected to <code>deanattali.com</code>, which showed my site :)</p>

<p>Fun fact: I also bought <code>daattali.com</code> because I&#39;m extremely undecisive and couldn&#39;t decide which domain name I would want to use. :)</p>

<h2>Misc</h2>

<p>While this site is built with Jekyll, I chose to (at least for now) keep it simple and let GitHub Pages compile Jekyll for me instead of installing and running it locally. I was on the fence about this because GitHub Pages does not support any custom plugins and there is one plugin I really want to write (and also you just have much more power and flexibility if you run Jekyll yourself), but I decided to let simplicity win this battle, with the benefit of being able to quickly update my site easily from any computer.  The plugin I wanted to add is a way to recognize whether or not a given file path is internal to the site or an absolute URL.  It would just make some of the templates less verbose and simpler if I could do that, but for now basic Jekyll&#39;l do. Jekyll will = Jekyll&#39;l, right? I think I just found today&#39;s weirdest word...</p>

<p>I also learned how easy and useful RSS feeds are, both as a user and as a writer. I just had to add a simple <a href="http://deanattali.com/feed.xml">feed XML file</a> and link to it in the website&#39;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and an RSS reader can pick it up automatically. The main reason I actually wanted to include an RSS feed was because <a href="www.r-bloggers.com">R bloggers</a> needs you to provide a feed in order to use your blog as content on their site. </p>

<p>Another thing I learned is how easy it is to integrate Google&#39;s search powers into your own site, <a href="http://deanattali.com/search">like so</a>.</p>
