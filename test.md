# You can finally select colours in Shiny with a colourInput

I don't always find missing functions in Shiny, but when I do - I fill in the gap myself. That was meant to be read as The Most Interesting Man In The World, but now that I think about it - maybe he's not the type of guy who would be building Shiny R packages...

Well, to be more accurate, `shiny` doesn't have it, but [`shinyjs`](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) now has a `colourInput`
